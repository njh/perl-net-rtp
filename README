Net-RTP version 0.02
====================

This is a pure perl implementation of Real-time Transport Protocol (RFC3550)


INSTALLATION
------------

	I use Module::Build to build and install the module.
	To install this module type the following:
	
		perl Build.PL
		./Build
		./Build test
		
	And then as root:
	
		./Build install

	Module::Build is available in the debian package:

		libmodule-build-perl


DEPENDENCIES
------------

	This module requires the IO::Socket::Multicast perl module,
	which in-turn requires IO::Interface.
